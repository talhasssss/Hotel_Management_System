## 📜 Project Overview
This project is a **Complex Computing Problem (CCP)** focused on developing a scalable Hotel Reservation System. The core objective is to translate a detailed **UML Class Diagram** into high-quality Java code, ensuring that all architectural relationships (Aggregation, Composition, and Association) are accurately represented.



---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **UML-to-Code Fidelity:** Precise implementation of classes like `Hotel_Chain`, `Room`, `Reservation`, and `ReserverPayer`.
- **Defensive Programming:** Robust validation logic to prevent illegal states (e.g., negative costs, null objects).
- **Unit Testing:** 100% verification of domain logic using **JUnit 5** and the **AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)** pattern.
- **Relationship Management:** Handles complex interactions between guest occupancy, room types, and chain-level reservations.

## 🧪 Testing Methodology (AAA Pattern)

We follow the industry-standard **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern to ensure each unit test is readable and maintainable.



| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Arrange** 🏗️ | Initialize objects, mock dependencies, and prepare input data. |
| **Act** ⚡ | Execute the specific method or function being tested. |
| **Assert** ✅ | Verify that the actual output matches the expected result. |

## 📊 Documentation Guide (For Reports)

If you are using this project for a formal report, use the following descriptions for your screenshots to provide a professional context:

> [!TIP]
> **Main Execution:** Shows system initialization, hotel setup, and successful reservation flow.
> 
> **Domain Logic:** Demonstrates defensive checks (e.g., preventing negative room costs or invalid dates).
> 
> **Test Suite:** Displays green checkmarks for all unit tests, confirming 100% functional correctness.
